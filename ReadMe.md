# Create Financial Data Structures: Time, Tick, Volume, and Dollar Bars

Version of Pycharm Professional Edition: 2017.3

Version of Python: 3.6.5

## Note: New Package
Please note that the functionality for creating the standard bar types (dollar, volume, and tick) have been improved on and added to our new package called mlfinlab. A link to the repo follows: [mlfinlab on github](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab)

A link to our group and public project board follows:
* [Hudson & Thames Group: Advances in Financial Machine Learning](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames)
* [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/hudson-and-thames/projects/1)

The new package is faster, easier to use, and will in the near future be available on the PyPi index. If you want a small sample of dollar bars, please email me. This package will include all the work from Advances in Financial Machine Learning. We welcome contributions to the project!

## Description

This program is to help users create structured financial data from unstructured data, in the form of time, tick, volume, and dollar bars.

The user passes tick data to the create_bars(data, units=1000, type='tick') function and it returns the desired structured data.
Everything can be found in the main.py file. I left lots of comments in the code. 

These bars are used throughout the text book (*Advances in Financial Machine Learning, By Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2018, pg 25*)
to build the more interesting features for predicting financial time series data.

A great paper to read more about how the tick, volume, and dollar bars have better statistical properties to standard time sampled data is:
[The Volume Clock: Insights into the high frequency paradigm, Lopez de Prado, et al](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2034858)

## Why Using Different Sampling Techniques is Cool!
The whole motivation behind sampling data differently to the traditional fixed time intervals, is that alternative methods offer better statistical properties.

The following is from de Prado's text book:

Fixed time interval sampling should be avoided for 2 reasons: 
1. Markets don't process information at fixed time intervals, time bars oversample during quiet periods and undersample during busy periods.
2. Time sampled bars often exhibit poor statistical properties:
    - Serial Correlation
    - Heteroscedasticity
    - Non Normality of Returns

[Mandlebrot and Taylor [1967]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/168611?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) were among the first to realize that sampling as a function of the number of transactions exhibited desirable statistical properties.
Multiple studies have confirmed that sampling as a function of trading activity allows us to achieve returns closer to IID Normal [Ane and Geman [2000]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/222489)

This is important because many statistical methods rely on the assumption that observations are drawn from an IID Gaussian process.

In the paper titled 'The Volume Clock' you will see the authors show standardized distributions of fixed time intervals and volume bars.
Notice how the volume bars have a lower kurtosis. If you check the notebook you will see that the test statistics from the Jarque-Bera normality tests are much
lower for non fixed time bars.

The code provided in this repo is some of the only code that de Prado doesn't offer in his text book and I thought that the community would find it useful
to have a repo from which they can access the code needed to build time, tick, volume, and dollar bars.

To show that the code is correct, I downloaded a small sample and plotted the same distribution.
20 days of tick data, E-mini S&P500 futures, 1 Sep 2013 to 20 Sep 2013.

As you can see from the results, the alternative bar types provide better statistical properties. A deeper dive can be found in the notebooks.

## Data Analysis Jupyter Notebook
The following data analysis is performed on the series of E-mini S&P 500 futures tick data:

1. Form tick, volume, and dollar bars
2. Count the number of bars produced by tick, volume, and dollar bars on a weekly basis.
Plot a time seiries of that bar count. What bar type produces the most stable weekly count? Why?
3. Compute serieal correlation of returns for the three bar types. What bar method has the lowest serial correlation?
4. Apply the Jarque-Bera normality test on returns from the three bar types. What method achieves the lowest test statistic?
5. Standardize & Plot the Distributions

## Installation on Mac OS X

Make sure you install the latest version of the Anaconda 3 distribution which must include an IDE like Spyder.
To do this you can follow the install and update instructions found on this link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#mac

To install the package dependency run: pip install -r pip_requirements.txt

From Spyder or Pycharm IDE: Open the file main.py and run it.

From Terminal: 

1. Go to the directory where you have saved the file, example: cd Desktop/bars/awesome/
2. pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
3. Run the file: main.py (python main.py)

### Troubleshoot:
**error: no module named cython_loops**

You need to compile the cython module locally. cd into the working dir and in the terminal type: python setup.py build_ext --inplace

**Note:** Please make sure you unzip the ES_Trades.csv.zip found in raw_tick_data, it was too big to upload without zipping it first.

## Installation on Ubuntu Linux

Make sure you install the latest version of the Anaconda 3 distribution which must include an IDE like Spyder.
To do this you can follow the install and update instructions found on this link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux

To install the package dependency run: pip install -r pip_requirements.txt

From Spyder or Pycharm IDE: Open the file main.py and run it.

From Terminal: 

1. Go to the directory where you have saved the file, example: cd Desktop/bars/awesome/
2. pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
3. Run the file: main.py (python main.py)

### Troubleshoot:
**error: no module named cython_loops**

You need to compile the cython module locally. cd into the working dir and in the terminal type: python setup.py build_ext --inplace

**Note:** Please make sure you unzip the ES_Trades.csv.zip found in raw_tick_data, it was too big to upload without zipping it first.

## Installation on Windows

A collegue of mine (Guillermo Izquierdo Colin) suggested the following for Windows users:
You can always use a virtualbox machine on Windows.

1. https://www.virtualbox.org/
2. Install an image of an Ubuntu or MacOS distribution
3. Install Anaconda3
4. Install Git
5. Clone repository
6. Build C packages, "python setup.py  build_ext --inplace"
7. and run the main.py  file.

The reason for this is because Windows doesn't lend itself well to python and cython. You need to wrestle a bear and then crawl on broken glass whilst humming Mozart's piano sonata no 13 in B flat major. Honestly, just install Linux. 

The following link is more useful for those pursuing the heroes journey: [How to deal with the pain of “unable to find vcvarsall.bat”](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2016/04/11/unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat/)

**Note:** Please make sure you unzip the ES_Trades.csv.zip found in raw_tick_data, it was too big to upload without zipping it first.

## Packages Used
Packages can all be installed by running the following command in the terminal (project working directory): "pip install -r pip_requirements.txt" 
* numpy==1.14.2
* pandas==0.22.0
* Cython==0.28.2

## Notes: 
* This program was built using a MacBook Pro on OS X.
* Python 3.6.5 was used
* Tested Successfully on both Mac OS X and Linux Ubuntu
